Using Selenium with Python to Scrape the UCSB Courses Search page

# Big Picture

Sometimes the data we want is on a web page, but not in a form that
makes it easy to work with.

For example, data about UCSB courses is available at the web page
<https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/public/curriculum/coursesearch.aspx>.

We might prefer to have that data in CSV format so that we can load it
into a spreadsheet, or in JSON format so that we can work with it in a
Python program.

The code in this repo shows how to use Python programming along
with a piece of software called
Selenium to "scrape" the data we want from the UCSB Courses Search page,
and then store it either in CSV or JSON format.
